## Coinflipper

A simple Java program to simulate coin flipping. It takes a user input for the number of simulations and runs a random boolean generator with a 50/50 chance which is then converted to enum. True is represented as heads and tails as false. The program then outputs the numbers of heads and tails simulated and the probabilities found in the simulation!
